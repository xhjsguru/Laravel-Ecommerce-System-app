in the doc at this page: http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/pagination we can see that we are not forced to use eloquent.

$users = DB::table('users')->paginate(15);
but, be sure you don't make a groupBy in your query because, the paginate method uses it.

after i'm no sure you can use paginate with query builder ( select($query) )

--- edit

You can create collection an use the paginator class :

$collection = new Collection($put_your_array_here);

// Paginate
$perPage = 10; // Item per page
$currentPage = Input::get('page') - 1; // url.com/test?page=2
$pagedData = $collection->slice($currentPage * $perPage, $perPage)->all();
$collection= Paginator::make($pagedData, count($collection), $perPage);
and in your view just use $collection->render();
