Just create your model inside app/models/MyModel.php like this

class MyModel{

    public static function getMyData(){
         DB::table('users')->select('column')->get();

    }
}
then you should be fine to call your new class statically:

$data = MyModel::getMyData();
If you wanted to extend the DB class you could,
though more likely you would be looking to extend the Database/Builder class to extend functionality
but this is a complex topic and I suspect you would have asked a very different question if this was what you were after.
