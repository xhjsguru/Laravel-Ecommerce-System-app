In Laravel 5 uses the same method as in laravel 4:

use View;
use Auth;

View::share('current_user', Auth::User());
or using the view helper:

view()->share('current_user', Auth::User());



First, you can probably create your own BaseController and extend it in other controllers.

Second thing is, that you may use Auth:user() directly in View,
you don't need to assign anything in the view.

For other usages you can go to app/Providers/App/ServiceProvider.php
and in boot method you can View::share('current_user', Auth::User());
but or course you need to add importing namespaces first:

use View;
use Auth;
because this file is in App\Providers namespace
