I was also getting this error. Adding below in composer.json fixed the issue:

"repositories": [
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "https://github.com/jamisonvalenta/Laravel-4-Generators.git"
        }
    ],
This is what my composer.json "require-dev" and "repositories" look like now:

"require-dev": {
        "fzaninotto/faker": "~1.4",
        "mockery/mockery": "0.9.*",
        "phpunit/phpunit": "~4.0",
        "phpspec/phpspec": "~2.1",
        "xethron/migrations-generator": "dev-l5",
        "way/generators": "dev-feature/laravel-five-stable"
    },
"repositories": [
        {
            "type": "git",
            "url": "https://github.com/jamisonvalenta/Laravel-4-Generators.git"
        }
    ],
I hope this helps someone.
