http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31253090/fire-an-event-when-the-user-logins-in-laravel
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31290012/events-to-send-mail-in-laravel-5-1?rq=1


The events you need to listen on are:

auth.login - fired when user logged in successfully
auth.logout - fired when user logged out
auth.attempt - fired when user attempts to log in
Those are the events that Laravel fires automatically - see
Illuminate\Auth\Guard class which is what you get when you use Auth facade.

In order for your listeners to work you need to do:

$events->listen(
    'auth.login',
    'App\Listeners\UserEventListener@onUserLogin'
);

$events->listen(
    'auth.logout',
    'App\Listeners\UserEventListener@onUserLogout'
);
Another option is to define separate handler classes for both events, e.g.:

class UserEventLoginHandler {
  public function handle($event) {
    //do some logic here
  }
}

class UserEventLogoutHandler {
  public function handle($event) {
    //do some logic here
  }
}
and then define listeners in :

protected $listen = array(
  'auth.login' => 'App\Listeners\UserEventLoginListener',
  'auth.logout' => 'App\Listeners\UserEventLogoutListener'
);
You can also use Laravel's command to generate the handlers - see
https://mattstauffer.co/blog/laravel-5.0-events-and-handlers for more details.




return redirect($this->loginPath()) // Change this to redirect elsewhere
                ->withInput($request->only('email', 'remember'))
                ->withErrors([
                    'active' => 'You must be active to login.'
                ]);



// This section is the only change
    if (Auth::validate($credentials)) {
        $user = Auth::getLastAttempted();
        if ($user->active) {
            Auth::login($user, $request->has('remember'));
            return redirect()->intended($this->redirectPath());
        } else {
            return redirect($this->loginPath()) // Change this to redirect elsewhere
                ->withInput($request->only('email', 'remember'))
                ->withErrors([
                    'active' => 'You must be active to login.'
                ]);
        }
    }


You can just override the getCredentials() method in your AuthController:

class AuthController extends Controller
{
    use AuthenticatesAndRegistersUsers;

    public function getCredentials()
    {
        $credentials = $request->only($this->loginUsername(), 'password');

        return array_add($credentials, 'active', '1');
    }
}
This will add the active = 1 constraint when trying to authenticate a user.

EDIT: If you want a separate error message like BrokenBinary says, then Laravel allows you to define a method called authenticated that is called after a user has been authenticated, but before the redirect, allowing you to do any post-login processing. So you could utilise this by checking if the authenticated user is active, and throw an exception or display an error message if not:

class AuthController extends Controller
{
    use AuthenticatesAndRegistersUsers;

    public function authenticated(Request $request, User $user)
    {
        if ($user->active) {
            return redirect()->intended($this->redirectPath());
        } else {
            // Raise exception, or redirect with error saying account is not active
        }
    }
}
Don�t forget to import the Request class and User model class.


protected function getCredentials(Request $request) {

        $request['active'] = TRUE;
        return $request->only($this->loginUsername(), 'password', 'active');
}

Example:

    $q->where('created_at', '>=', '2015-01-01 00:00:00');

// only users that have posts from this year are returned

+1, very helpful answer! Note also that while with('relation') will include the related table's data in the returned collection, has('relation') and 
whereHas('relation') will not include the related table's data. So you may need to call both with('relation') as well as has() or whereHas()


$query = Product::query();
foreach(Input::get('filter') as $attributeId => $optionIds){
    foreach($optionIds as $optionId){
        $query->whereHas('attributeOptions', function($q) use ($attributeId, $optionId){

When building web applications, it�s important to understand where bottle necks are likely to appear first. Reducing the number of database queries down to be as efficient as possible is the first step towards building an application that will scale.

However a lot of developers make the mistake of writing inefficient database queries that are hard to spot and using an ORM like Eloquent can hide the problem until it�s too late. You don�t want to wake up one morning to find your application has been hosed because you wrote a query that killed your database.

In this article I�m going to be looking at Eager Loading in Laravel 4. Eager Loading helps to alleviate the N + 1 problem so that when you make database queries, you aren�t secretly running hundreds of queries when you should just be running one or two.

What is the N + 1 problem?
The N + 1 problem is where you load a set of records and then you request an attribute which is a relation to each of those records.

For example, say your application has users and posts. Your relationship might look something like this in your User model:

?
/**
 * Post relationship
 */
public function posts()
{
  return $this->hasMany('Post');
}
For each user you want to list their post titles. So you might write something like this:

$users = User::all();
 
foreach($users as $user)
{
  echo $user->posts->title;
}
This would work exactly how you intended it to.

However, under the surface your application is actually not very efficient. when you run the code above, you would be running the following database queries:


SELECT * from users;
SELECT * from posts WHERE user_id = 1;
SELECT * from posts WHERE user_id = 2;
SELECT * from posts WHERE user_id = 3;
SELECT * from posts WHERE user_id = 4;
SELECT * from posts WHERE user_id = 5;
�
So if you have 1000 users, your database would be running 1000 + 1 queries to run this little chunk of code. That�s where the N + 1 name comes from.

What is Eager Loading?
Eager loading is a method for defining what we are going to need ahead of time so that we can run more efficient database queries.

So instead of getting all users and then requesting the posts for each user, we can declare that we also want the user�s posts when we select the users.

Fortunately Laravel 4 makes this really easy.

So in the case of the example above, we could write the following which would be much more efficient:


$users = User::with('posts')->get();
 
foreach($users as $user)
{
  echo $user->posts->title;
}
Using Eager Loading, Laravel would actually be running the following queries:

select * from users
select * from posts where user_id in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...)
So as you can see, we�ve reduced 1000+ queries down to two. Running the two queries above is much more efficient than running them as separate queries, especially if your database is on another server.

Laravel Eager Loading extras
Laravel makes it really easy to do Eager Loading on your database, but it can also do much more than simply solving the N + 1 problem.

Loading multiple relationships
For example, say you wanted to load multiple relationships. You can achieve this by simply passing multiple options to the with method:

$users = User::with('posts', 'followers')->get();
Loading nested relationships
Sometimes you will want to load relationships that are nested. A common example of this would be to load all users, their posts and the comments on a post. As you can imagine this is some pretty heavy query work, but eager loading can make this more efficient.

$users = User::with('posts.comments')->get();
Eager Loading with constraints
And finally, often you will want to eager load relationships but with a constraint because you know you don�t need to load every record.

Laravel 4 solves this problem by allowing you to pass a Closure to specify the WHERE clause. For example:


$users = User::with(array('posts' => function($query)
{
  $query->where('published', '=', 1);
}))->get();


In the example above, I would only be loading a user�s posts if they were published. If I was using this query to display a list of posts on the user�s profile page, there is no need to load any draft or unpublished posts.

Conclusion
In the early days of building a web application, eager loading can take very inefficient queries and boil them down to become efficient. This can make your application feel much quicker because you will be able to massively reduce the back and forth with the database.

Eager Loading is an excellent practice for building high quality web applications and so you should leverage this technique whenever you want to load records and relationships.

However, Eager Loading will not solve all of your problems forever. If you are lucky enough to really find traction with your application there will come a point where even Eager Loading is not efficient enough for you.



$posts = Post::with('user')
     ->with(array('comments'=>function($query){
         $query->where('user_id', '=', 3);
         $query->with('user');
     }))
     ->with('tags')
     ->where('travel_area_id','=',$area->id)
     ->take($this->numOfPostsInAreaPageLoad)
     ->orderBy('created_at', 'DESC')
     ->get();




It looks like you don't even need a nested eager load, you just need to modify the query that with returns, so:

$posts = Post::with('comments')->where('user_id', '=', 1)->get();
You can daisy chain most of the methods in the Eloquent system, generally they're just returning a Fluent query object.

(I haven't tested it but I'm fairly certain that'll work. Also, you can't do it on ::all() because that calls ->get() for you. You have to dig in the source code to find this, I don't think the Eloquent documentation mentions that's what it's doing.)

Also the Eager Loading Documentation covers nested eager loading, so you could load all users, with their posts, with the comments:

You may even eager load nested relationships. For example, let's assume our Author model has a "contacts" relationship. We can eager load both of the relationships from our Book model like so:

$books = Book::with(array('author', 'author.contacts'))->get();






public static function getLatest()
    {
        $result = Product::orderBy('product_id', 'desc')->take('6') ->get();
        return $result;
    }

    public static function getRandom()
    {
        $result = Product::orderBy('product_id', 'desc')->get()->random(6);
        return $result;
    }

In the previous part, we�ve bootstrapped our Laravel CRUD application by creating the database, some controllers,
 basic routes and simple views. In this part, we�ll wrap things up and implement proper CRUD.

Laravel Logo

If you�d like to follow along through this interactive walk through Laravel�s docs, please catch up by reading the first part now.

Creating A Record
Continuing right where we left off, let�s create the page where we�ll actually perform this action. In our TasksController,
 let�s return a view like this:

public function create()
{
    return view('tasks.create');
}
And now, in our views directory, let�s create tasks/create.blade.php, and enter some starter content:

@extends('layouts.master')

@section('content')

<h1>Add a New Task</h1>
<p class="lead">Add to your task list below.</p>
<hr>

@stop
At this point, we could manually create a form, but Laravel offers a package to lighten this load for us � Illuminate/Html.
 Let�s pull that in quickly by running the following command:

composer require illuminate/html
Now, inside our config/app.php file, let�s add the service provider to the list:

'Illuminate\Html\HtmlServiceProvider',
Let�s add the aliases:

'Form'      => 'Illuminate\Html\FormFacade',
'Html'      => 'Illuminate\Html\HtmlFacade',
We can now easily create a form in our create.blade.php file. Let�s go ahead and do that using the form facade and blade syntax:

{!! Form::open([
    'route' => 'tasks.store'
]) !!}

<div class="form-group">
    {!! Form::label('title', 'Title:', ['class' => 'control-label']) !!}
    {!! Form::text('title', null, ['class' => 'form-control']) !!}
</div>

<div class="form-group">
    {!! Form::label('description', 'Description:', ['class' => 'control-label']) !!}
    {!! Form::textarea('description', null, ['class' => 'form-control']) !!}
</div>

{!! Form::submit('Create New Task', ['class' => 'btn btn-primary']) !!}

{!! Form::close() !!}
Check out this screenshot of our create view so far.

Create view default

One important thing to note here is that I�ve specified the route on which we will POST to,
 according to our resourceful routes list. We�ll use the store method to process the data, so let�s head back to our TasksController, and start processing that data.

Let�s turn our heads to requests in Laravel.

The Request facade will grant you access to the current request that is bound in the container.
We can obtain our request instance in two ways, according to the documentation. Let�s stick with the dependency injection method.
 Our store method should now look like this:

public function store(Request $request)
{
    //
}
Now, we can dump out the information to see what gets posted. We�ll use the helper function, dd(),
 which is included by default in Laravel. It combines Symphony�s VarDupmer component,
 and the PHP die function. Add the following to the store method:

dd($request->all());
Now submit the empty form, and you�ll see the data. Go back and fill in some dummy data in the form, and you�ll
 see the request updated. If we�re not interested in any validation, then saving the new task to the database is easy.
 In the docs for Eloquent, we�ll notice that we can call the create method to create a new row in our table. Let�s do that by adding the following to our store method. We�ll also redirect back to where we came from:

public function store(Request $request)
{
    $input = $request->all();

    Task::create($input);

    return redirect()->back();
}
We�re ready to create a new task now. Let�s go ahead and enter some dummy data and submit it.
 Uh oh� there�s a MassAssignmentException. Laravel by default prevents mass assignment, which is a good thing. This just means that we have to declare which fields are mass-assignable. I suggest you read up on this, but here�s what our updated Task model will look like:

class Task extends Model {

    /**
     * Fillable fields
     * 
     * @var array
     */
    protected $fillable = [
        'title',
        'description'
    ];

}
Now, let�s try to add our task again. If we were successful, we should be redirected back to where we came from,
 i.e. the �create task� page. There�s no indication right now as to whether the task was successfully added,
 but let�s check the database through the command line:

sqlite3 storage/database.sqlite
select * from tasks;
We should see the table returned with our new entry. Sweet! What about success messages and validation?
 Let�s first validate our input, to make sure all fields are required. Laravel ships with a really easy-to-use Validator
 class, and a quick read should have us going in no time. We�re validating in our controller, so let�s look at that section.
 Let�s validate our input by adding this to the beginning of the store method:

$this->validate($request, [
    'title' => 'required',
    'description' => 'required'
]);
Notice now that if we leave out any of our input, the rest of our method doesn�t execute,
 and we remain on the page with whatever input has already been entered. Laravel will automatically throw an error,
 which we can access in our blade template. Let�s insert the following snippet above our form:

@if($errors->any())
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
        @foreach($errors->all() as $error)
            <p>{{ $error }}</p>
        @endforeach
    </div>
@endif
Now, we�ll see the errors neatly written out for us.

Create task errors

What about a success message? Well, if our validator passes, the rest of our code will execute,
 and we can redirect back with a Session flash message. Update the store method to create a new flash message:

public function store(Request $request)
{
    $this->validate($request, [
        'title' => 'required',
        'description' => 'required'
    ]);

    $input = $request->all();

    Task::create($input);

    Session::flash('flash_message', 'Task successfully added!');

    return redirect()->back();
}
Now, we can add this to our blade template:

@if(Session::has('flash_message'))
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        {{ Session::get('flash_message') }}
    </div>
@endif
Here�s what we should see.

Create success message

We�re now validating and adding tasks, as well as passing data back to the view for output. Excellent.
 We still need a way to actually see our records.

Reading Records
Back in our index method, we can now output all tasks that we�ve created so far. Add this to the index method:

public function index()
{
    $tasks = Task::all();

    return view('tasks.index')->withTasks($tasks);
}
We can access and output the tasks like this:

@foreach($tasks as $task)
    <h3>{{ $task->title }}</h3>
    <p>{{ $task->description}}</p>
    <p>
        <a href="{{ route('tasks.show', $task->id) }}" class="btn btn-info">View Task</a>
        <a href="{{ route('tasks.edit', $task->id) }}" class="btn btn-primary">Edit Task</a>
    </p>
    <hr>
@endforeach
Here�s a screenshot for the index view.

Task listing

Let us now figure out how we�re going to display a single record. In this current app, it�s probably not
 necessary because we�re already outputting all the information, but we�ll do it anyway. If we look at our routes list,
 it�s apparent that the tasks.show route is the way to go. It accepts a wildcard in the URL, and for our app,
 we�ll use the ID of the task. As before, we�ll create a show.blade.php file and extend our master layout:

@extends('layouts.master')

@section('content')

<h1>{{ $task->title }}</h1>
<p class="lead">{{ $task->description }}</p>
<hr>

<a href="{{ route('tasks.index') }}" class="btn btn-info">Back to all tasks</a>
<a href="{{ route('tasks.edit', $task->id) }}" class="btn btn-primary">Edit Task</a>

<div class="pull-right">
    <a href="#" class="btn btn-danger">Delete this task</a>
</div>

@stop
Now, let�s update our show method:

public function show($id)
{
    return view('tasks.show');
}
If we navigate to a URL with a random wildcard � /tasks/320918 � we should see our dummy template. Let�s actually
 fetch the correct task. Using Eloquent, we can search for a record with the matching ID, and if none are found,
 we�ll throw a ModelNotFoundException which we can catch. If the record is found, we can access it in our view.
 Here�s the updated method:

public function show($id)
{
    $task = Task::findOrFail($id);

    return view('tasks.show')->withTask($task);
}
Now in our view, we can output the record properly like this:

<h1>{{ $task->title }}</h1>
<p class="lead">{{ $task->description }}</p>
Navigate to tasks/1, and you should see the output.

Single task view

Back in our index view, we can now output the links to each individual task:

<a href="{{ route('tasks.show', $task->id) }}">view</a>
Notice that we passed in the correct wildcard based on the task ID. You should now be able to click through nicely!
 Let�s move on to editing.

Updating A Record Using Form-Model Binding
By now, you probably realize how easy it is to get a new view ready for our RESTful app. It�s no different this time,
 so we�ll create the edit.blade.php file, pull in the master layout, and link the corresponding controller method to it.
 Here�s the edit method:

public function edit($id)
{
    return view('tasks.edit');
}
And here�s the view to match:

@extends('layouts.master')

@section('content')

<h1>Edit Task - Task Name </h1>
<p class="lead">Edit this task below. <a href="{{ route('tasks.index') }}">Go back to all tasks.</a></p>
<hr>

@stop
If you look at the routes list, you�ll notice that the edit route also accepts a wildcard.
 We�ll be consistent and use the ID. Navigating to /tasks/gibberish/edit will display the dummy page,
 but let�s pull in the proper content. First of all, we can update all our �edit� links on the index and show views like this:

<a href="{{ route('tasks.edit', $task->id) }}">edit</a>
Notice again how we�re calling the correct route and passing in the corresponding wildcard. In our edit template,
 we�re going to want a similar form to the one we used to create a task, but it would be pretty useful if the form
 was already populated with the existing fields. Thanks to Laravel�s form-model binding, this is a piece of cake.
 We�ll copy over the create form, although a better practice would be to extract this to a partial of some sort. In any case,
 we�ll copy it over, and bind our model to it:

{!! Form::model($task, [
    'method' => 'PATCH',
    'route' => ['tasks.update', $task->id]
]) !!}

<div class="form-group">
    {!! Form::label('title', 'Title:', ['class' => 'control-label']) !!}
    {!! Form::text('title', null, ['class' => 'form-control']) !!}
</div>

<div class="form-group">
    {!! Form::label('description', 'Description:', ['class' => 'control-label']) !!}
    {!! Form::textarea('description', null, ['class' => 'form-control']) !!}
</div>

{!! Form::submit('Update Task', ['class' => 'btn btn-primary']) !!}

{!! Form::close() !!}
Notice how we�re using a PATCH request in the form to stay in line with our RESTful resource.
 Notice also how we are calling on the variable $task, binding it to the model, and referencing the
 ID which will be used to look up the table. This means that we have to pass in the correct task. In the TasksController,
 we can update the edit method to this:

public function edit($id)
{
    $task = Task::findOrFail($id);

    return view('tasks.edit')->withTask($task);
}
Just like before, if an ID isn�t found, we�ll get the ModelNotFoundException. We can, at this point,
 copy over our errors snippet again, but this isn�t very DRY at all. Don�t worry, we can fix that easily by leveraging partials. Blade allows us to reference any file by using the @include() directive. First, let�s create a folder in our views directory called partials. In there, I�ll create a sub-directory called alerts, and then a file called errors.blade.php. Let�s copy over our errors snippet into this new file:

@if($errors->any())
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
        @foreach($errors->all() as $error)
            <p>{{ $error }}</p>
        @endforeach
    </div>
@endif
Now, we can reference it in any of our files like this:

@include('partials.alerts.errors')
We can now replace the original snippet in our create.blade.php template with this partial reference,
 and reference it in our edit template as well. The whole edit view should look like this now:

@extends('layouts.master')

@section('content')

<h1>Editing "{{ $task->title }}"</h1>
<p class="lead">Edit and save this task below, or <a href="{{ route('tasks.index') }}">go back to all tasks.</a></p>
<hr>

@include('partials.alerts.errors')

@if(Session::has('flash_message'))
    <div class="alert alert-success">
        {{ Session::get('flash_message') }}
    </div>
@endif

{!! Form::model($task, [
    'method' => 'PATCH',
    'route' => ['tasks.update', $task->id]
]) !!}

<div class="form-group">
    {!! Form::label('title', 'Title:', ['class' => 'control-label']) !!}
    {!! Form::text('title', null, ['class' => 'form-control']) !!}
</div>

<div class="form-group">
    {!! Form::label('description', 'Description:', ['class' => 'control-label']) !!}
    {!! Form::textarea('description', null, ['class' => 'form-control']) !!}
</div>

{!! Form::submit('Update Task', ['class' => 'btn btn-primary']) !!}

{!! Form::close() !!}

@stop
Here�s a screenshot of the view when we�re editing a task.

Editing a task

Let�s jump into our update method now, which will receive the data from the form submission, and try to update our record.
 Like before, we�ll validate our input, and log the errors in our view if any exist. If validation passes, we�ll grab the input, update the task, save it, and redirect back with a success message. Here�s what the method looks like:

public function update($id, Request $request)
{
    $task = Task::findOrFail($id);

    $this->validate($request, [
        'title' => 'required',
        'description' => 'required'
    ]);

    $input = $request->all();

    $task->fill($input)->save();

    Session::flash('flash_message', 'Task successfully added!');

    return redirect()->back();
}
Try it out and see for yourself, it works! You can now create, read, and update records,
 but let�s cross the final hurdle.

Deleting A Record
Deleting a record RESTfully actually requires a DELETE request.
 You can get around this outside the controller with JavaScript, but that�s a bit beyond the scope of this article. If we view a single task, you�ll notice that I left a placeholder button there to delete it. We actually need to change this into a form that sends a DELETE request to the destroy method, and handle the record deletion there. Here�s our updated show template incorporating the delete form:

@extends('layouts.master')

@section('content')

<h1>{{ $task->title }}</h1>
<p class="lead">{{ $task->description }}</p>
<hr>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <a href="{{ route('tasks.index') }}" class="btn btn-info">Back to all tasks</a>
        <a href="{{ route('tasks.edit', $task->id) }}" class="btn btn-primary">Edit Task</a>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 text-right">
        {!! Form::open([
            'method' => 'DELETE',
            'route' => ['tasks.destroy', $task->id]
        ]) !!}
            {!! Form::submit('Delete this task?', ['class' => 'btn btn-danger']) !!}
        {!! Form::close() !!}
    </div>
</div>

@stop
Inside our TaskController, we can handle the request in the destroy method, rounding off our RESTful controller.
 Once again, Eloquent makes this a breeze.
 We�ll fetch the associated record in the table, delete it, and redirect back to the task list:

public function destroy($id)
{
    $task = Task::findOrFail($id);

    $task->delete();

    Session::flash('flash_message', 'Task successfully deleted!');

    return redirect()->route('tasks.index');
}
At this point, let�s refactor our flash message into the master layout file so that it shows up on
 every template whenever a flash message is posted. We can remove it from the create and edit templates,
 and keep it only in the master layout like this:

<main>
    <div class="container">
        @if(Session::has('flash_message'))
            <div class="alert alert-success">
                {{ Session::get('flash_message') }}
            </div>
        @endif
        
        @yield('content')
    </div>
</main>
Now, navigate to a task, and delete it. You�ll be redirected back to the task list with a flash message
 informing you that the task has successfully been deleted. Of course, your task list will be updated to match.
